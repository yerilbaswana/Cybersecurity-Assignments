1.  Topic - Command injection in DVWA: Remotely, find out the user of the web service on the OS and the machine's hostname via RCE
2.  Observations - 
    a. The difficulty was set to Low, Medium and High for testing purposes.
    b. At low difficulty, there is no input sanitisation allowing direct injection using all escape characters such as &, |, ;.
    c. At medium difficukty, the developer implements some form of input sanitisation but as noticed from the source code, it isn't 
        enough making injection possible using certain escape characters such as &.
    d. At high difficulty, the developer has implemented stricter sanitisation but has made some typos as noticed in source code, 
        thus injection is still possible using |.
    e. At each difficulty, it was possible to succefully inject commands and execute them at the privilege level of the web server, 
        thus getting the user of the web service and the hostname of the machine.
3.  Inferences - 
    a. As the input sanitisation improved, the chances of a command injection attack reduced and made it difficult.
    b. Thus, input sanitisation makes for a good solution for command injection.
    c. Command injection can lead to severe consequences, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, system compromise, and to 
        other network resources.
    d. The consequences increase substantially if a server is running on elevated privileges.
4. Conclusion -  
    a. Input validation and sanitisation are necessary to avoid command injection.
    b. Principle of least privilege should also be implemented to ensure that less amount of privileged information can be accessed 
        assuming a command injection does succeed.
