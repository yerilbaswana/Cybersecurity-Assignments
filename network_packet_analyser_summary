1.  Task - Automated network packet analysis
    a. Capture packets live upto a certain packet count.
    b. Analyze the captured packets to extract relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols used, and ports.
2.  Observations - 
    a. The packet count was set to 100 so 100 packets were captured.
    b. Majority of traffic was HTTP, HTTPS, DNS related, along with some TCP & UDP packets.
    c. Captured packets showed various source and destination IP addresses, indicating communication with multiple servers and clients.
        Some IPs were encountered more frequently signifying DNS servers and devices.
    d. The source and destination ports were also captured.
    e. No packets were flagged as anomalous.
3. Inferences - 
    a. The network traffic patterns suggested typical user behavior such as web browsing and DNS lookups.
    b. Frequent communication with certain IP addresses and a lot of HTTP & HTTPS requests suggested routine activities like accessing 
        popular websites.
    c. There were no unusual port numbers or IP addresses which suggested any anomalous behaviour.
4.  Conclusions - 
    a. Automated tools provide visibility into ongoing network activities, helping administrators understand and monitor network usage.
    b. Automated analysis can help detect unusual or potentially malicious activities, such as unexpected ports or communication with 
        unfamiliar IP addresses.
    c. Implementing such automated analysis scripts can enhance continuous monitoring efforts, allowing for real-time detection and 
        response to network issues.
