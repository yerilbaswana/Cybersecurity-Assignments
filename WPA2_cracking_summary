1. Topic - WPA2 Cracking
2. Observations - WPA2 can easily be cracked using a tool called aircrack-ng. 
  This is possible due to the handshake which happens during the authentication procedure. 
  It is also possbile to do denial of service attack by using deauth commands from aircrack-ng.
  Finally, a local database of passwords is used to crack the handshake thus revealing the password.
3. Inferences - The cracking of the password from the handshake is highly dependent on the database present with the hacker. 
  Thus, keeping unique and complex passwords according to password hygiene guidelines reduces the risk of this attack. 
  Furthermore, if the devices of the user supports WPA3 then it should be used for better security as this attack isn't possible on it due to dragonfly handshake.
  Also, deauthentication attack is also not possible on WPA3 due to encrypted management frames being present.
4. Conclusion - In this assignment, vulnerabilities of WPA2 are exposed and shown how they can be exploited.
  It shows how the 4 way handshake during authentication procedure can be captured and later an offline dictionary attack can be used to get the password.
  It can be avoided by keeping complex passwords which reduces the chances of password being in the hacker's password databases.
  Another solution is using WPA3 which was introduced in 2018. It avoids the above attack by having a dragonfly handshake. 
  It also avoids deauthentication attack by having encrypted management frames. 
  The only issue with using WPA3 is that a lot of devices don't recognise WPA3 since it's new and made manadatory in 2020.
